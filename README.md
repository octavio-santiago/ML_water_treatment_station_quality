# Monitoring a Water Treatment Station effluent quality with Machine Learning 
Project to predict the quality of water treatment station effluents using process data.

## Abstract
The biological wastewater treatment process is quite complex and hard to control and monitor by conventional means because it has many different variables and dynamics. This article aims at emphasizing the implementation of an emerging technology, machine learning, that can be applied to various industrial sectors with high growth potential and highlight the investment opportunity in its implementation in the area of industrial wastewater treatment. Throughout the work, it was analyzed the potential of applying a supervised machine learning algorithm to predict the effluent quality of an activated sludge biological treatment process along with a monitoring solution of the key performance indicators of the wastewater treatment. This work was developed in partnership with a petrochemical company in order to demonstrate to the scientific community the applicability of the proposed solution and its technical and economic viability. The result shows that the predictability of effluent quality would be totally feasible and its implementation could generate a profitable operation with great savings in laboratory analysis, as well as faster decision making than by conventional means.
